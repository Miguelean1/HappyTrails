**"Happy Travel.Fakest destinies, realest code"**


Welcome to my first "serious" project in HTML. The idea was to fork a Figma (from Do√±a Paloma, our teacher), and to try and give it some unique vibes.

First, all of us have made some changes in the design, colors, general structure (on my case, I've tried with some square cards) and details. We'll have a header with some icons, and a search-box. We'll have a footer with some links and info (I don't really know where i like most the search-box to be); and we'll have a body with some destinies organized in cards inside a grid layout. Also, in folder *ArtSyles* you can check different inspirations.

All the info is fake; not serious, and the destinies too. But the code is real. The code is always real.
