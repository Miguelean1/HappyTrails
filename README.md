      Welcome to my first "serious" project in HTML!
    
    ## **Who am I?** 

           I'm Mike, a young student of web-design trying to achieve a place in here. 

    ## **What was the plan?** 
    
            The idea was to fork a Figma (from Doña Paloma, our teacher), and to try and give it some unique vibes. After the Figma design,
        we had to replicate (and improve it, in this case) in basic HTML and CSS. 

            First, all of us have made some changes in the design, colors, general structure (on my case, I've tried with some square
        cards) and details. We'll have a header with some icons, and a search-box. We'll have a footer with some links and info (I don't
        really know where i like most the search-box to be); and we'll have a body with some destinies organized in cards inside a grid
        layout. Also, in folder *ArtSyles* you can check different inspirations.
    
        All the info is fake; not serious, and the destinies too. But the code is real. The code is always real.
