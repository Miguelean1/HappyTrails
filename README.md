Welcome to my first "serious" project in HTML!
    
 ## **Who am I?** 

I'm Mike, a young student of web-design trying to achieve a place in here. 

 ## **What was the plan?** 📝
    
The idea was to fork a Figma (from Doña Paloma, our teacher), and to try and give it some unique vibes. After the Figma design,
we had to replicate (and improve it, in this case) in basic HTML and CSS. 

First, all of us have made some changes in the design, colors, general structure (on my case, I've tried with some square
cards) and details. We'll have a header with some icons, and a search-box. We'll have a footer with some links and info (I don't
really know where i like most the search-box to be); and we'll have a body with some destinies organized in cards inside a grid
layout. Also, in folder *ArtSyles* you can check the different inspirations we'been trying in classroom.
    
All the info is fake; not serious, and the destinies too. But the code is real. The code is always real.

This is a the header, simple and clean, with  the brand image in the top-left area. Also, we have some buttons to interact (with 
some hover), and a search-box.

Just some text with the main idea behind our design. And a toggle to open a form where you can organize your own trip.

Some popular destinies between our regular users. I've used Cloudinary to host the images, and Squoosh to help me with the weights 
(in order to improve the eficiency).

A footer with the social links to principal sites. Also a checkox to open a mini-form to subscribe on a newsletter.

The checkbox.

This is the principal form, where you can fill some boxes. Also you can check some buttons with your favourite travel-way. 
I've used Font-Awesome for the icons.
